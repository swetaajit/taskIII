### Pulse With Modulation(PWM)
Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a modulation technique that generates variable-width pulses to represent the amplitude of an analog input signal. The output switching transistor is on more of the time for a high-amplitude signal and off more of the time for a low-amplitude signal.
### Circuit Connections
Connect the digital I/O pin 9 from Arduino UNO with the anode of the LED. Then, connect the cathode of the LED with a series resistor of 1000 Ohms and ground the other terminal from the resistor. The DC supply voltage and ground can be given to the circuit by  the ground pins of the Arduino UNO.
